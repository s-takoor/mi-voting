** üö´ THE CHALLENGES
-  üåü *Mi-Voting* dApp: A Technological Leap to Overcome Challenges
|--------------------+------------------------|
| BLOCKCHAIN-POWERED | TRADITIONAL            |
|--------------------+------------------------|
| - decentralized    | - centralized          |
| - transparent      | - lack of transparency |
| - secure           | - security issues      |
|--------------------+------------------------|
#+BEGIN_NOTES
- decentralized advantage
 + decentralizes the voting process, eliminating a central authority and ensuring a more democratic and tamper-resistant environment
- transparency boost
  + transparency by recording all transactions publicly, building trust in the integrity of the voting process
- security measures
  + decentralized and cryptographic nature of blockchain ensures high level of security, each vote is securely recorded and cannot be altered, providing a robust defense against unauthorized manipulation

- lack of transparency
  + votes often happen behind closed doors in traditional systems, making it difficult to verify accuracy of results
- security issues
  + vulnerbilities in traditional systems leave room for manipulation and fraud
- inefficiencies and potential fraud
  + cumbersome processes in traditional voting can lead to errors and fraud
